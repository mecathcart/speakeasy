<H1>Welcome to the Speakeasy</H1>

<P> It is 1928, Chicago, Illinois and you are trying to get into one of the town's most infamous speakeasies, i.e. a night club that sells alcoholic beverages during the Prohibition era when selling alcohol was illegal in the United States.  Your friends are inside and you want to see them.  However, in order to see them you need to convince the bouncer that you are not a cop.  To convince the bouncer, you must tell him the secret password, the noun, "record"  However, the cops have think that they know the password, except they think it's the verb "record".  You must correctly say the word to get inside to see your friends.  Luckily, as your speakeasy guide, I am here to help you speak the code easily.  We will practice, while we wait in line outside the speakeasy.  Each step you complete will get you closer to the bouncer at the door of the club.

<p> First, you must be able to hear the different between the two words.  The primary difference between the two words is stress, can you determine the stress syllable in each of the following words?

<p> Why are the syllables stressed? 

<p>Because it had too many bills to pay! 

<p>Why do we say these syllables are stressed? or How are these syllables stressed?  In English, stress is expressed in several ways. A stressed syllable in English is typically longer, louder and higher-pitched. than the unstressed syllables in the word.

These are waveforms that show us the shape and form of words. We can see how long and loud different sounds are by using these waveforms.  The following waveforms are the noun verb pair ‘REcord’ and ‘reCORD’.  As in “I want to reCORD a REcord.”  The black lines on top measure the amplitude.  From these two spectrograms, you can clearly see that the two words although spelt the same, and have the same consonants, are very different.  Let’s look first at the one on the left, ‘REcord’.  Here the first syllable ‘RE’ is much louder than the second syllable “cord”.  It is also a little bit longer, and it is definitely longer than the same syllable ‘re’ in the picture on the right.  In the spectrogram on the right,  we can see that the second syllable ‘CORD’ is both louder and longer than the first syllable ‘re’.  ‘CORD’ is also longer than its unstressed counterpart on the left.

<p>

Of the three indicators of stress, this is the one that native English speakers rely on the most to determine the correct word stress and thus, successfully identify the correct word. English is considered a stressed timed language.  This means that the timing of the syllables will depend on stress so that some syllables are long and some are short.  This gives English its distinctive rhythm.  Many other languages are referred to as syllable-timed languages meaning each syllable is the same length of time as other syllables.

 <p> It may feel like you are being a bit silly to be really exaggerating these syllables, but Americans really do stretch their syllables out.  It helps to put the word in a sentence and add emphasis.  For example “You have to beliiieve in yourself!”
